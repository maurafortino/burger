# burger app

## How it works

* on the left hand side is a list of burgers, all of which appeared as the burger of the day in Bob's Burgers

* when a user clicks on a burgers name from the first column it will be added to the second column. from there they can choose to click the devour it button next to the witing to be eaten burgers.

* if a user clicks "devour it" that burger will be removed from the "waiting to be eaten" column (second) and be added to the "devoured" column (third) and they will not be able to click or edit that column.

### Dependencies
* MySQL
* Express
* Express-Handlebars
